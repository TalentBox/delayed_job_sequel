==================

* Allow overriding the Job table name

**BREAKING CHANGE**

In order to support the Job's table name override, requiring `delayed_job_sequel`
no longer set the backend. You will have to do it manually (for example in an
initializer):

```ruby
::Delayed::Job.backend = :sequel
```

==================

* Compatibility with Ruby 2.0, 2.1 and JRuby

* Update Sequel dependency to allow versions from `3.38` to `4.x`
